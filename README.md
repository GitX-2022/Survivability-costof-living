# Survivability-costof-living

This app would be useful for estimating the cost of living in a city (within India). Users who would like to shift to another city will be able to find out the list of feasible options where they could relocate to.  
Given their income and a few other parameters, the app calculates an average estimate of their monthly expenditure. We also ask the user about how much they would like to save. Based on the expenditure calculated, we also provide the user with the amount of money he is likely to save per month upon moving to the city.  

Minor Error in Deployment 
There was a CORS issue, so we couldn't completely deploy our model.
